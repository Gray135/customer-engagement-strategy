## üß≠ 1-Minute Summary
Built a full-cycle **Customer Success Operations (CS Ops)** model using **Excel, SQL, and Power BI** to simulate how teams track engagement, identify at-risk customers, and plan retention outreach.  
The dashboard combines CLV tiers, satisfaction scores, and escalation risk to show where attention is needed most ‚Äî like a simplified Gainsight or Salesforce CS view.  
This project highlights practical skills in **SQL view design, Power BI data modeling, DAX measures,** and turning CX data into business insights.

## Business Objective

Customer Success and Operations teams need to know:
- Who‚Äôs most at risk of churning?
- What‚Äôs driving engagement and satisfaction?
- Where should outreach and resources go first?

This project simulates that workflow using structured logic across **Excel ‚Üí SQL ‚Üí Power BI**, mirroring how CS Ops teams use platforms like Gainsight or Salesforce to manage account health and retention.

**Goal:**  
Create a full-cycle model that:
1. Flags at-risk customers  
2. Segments them by CLV, engagement, and satisfaction  
3. Recommends a data-driven ‚Äúnext best action‚Äù for retention and outreach  

The result is a practical, BI-ready framework that blends Excel business logic with scalable SQL views and Power BI visuals ‚Äî the kind of workflow a real CS Ops or VoC Analyst would use to prioritize high-impact accounts.

## Key Insights

| **Insight** | **What It Means** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **96% of customers** fall in the low-CLV ($0‚Äì2k) range | The retention backbone ‚Äî focus here for scalable impact |
| **High-CLV customers** show **lower engagement** | Warning sign for targeted reactivation campaigns |
| **Repeat rate (84%)** | Indicates strong loyalty base to maintain and expand |
| **Income Index (~1.9)** | Spending skews mid-tier, not luxury ‚Äî outreach tone matters |
| **Channel engagement varies** | Different segments prefer email, mobile, or social ‚Äî personalize contact strategy |

These insights connect directly to the dashboard visuals, where each page highlights how engagement, satisfaction, and CLV interact to shape retention priorities.

## Data Source


All data in this project is **simulated** and designed to reflect what a real Customer Success or CX Analytics team might work with.

The dataset structure mirrors typical operational fields used for retention and engagement analysis:

- Customer demographics (gender, income level, country, tenure group)  
- Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and total order value  
- Engagement and satisfaction scores  
- Premium membership and repeat status  
- Escalation risk level and support interaction history  
- Channel engagement (email, mobile, social)

No real customer information is used ‚Äî this dataset is for **demonstration and portfolio purposes only.**

---

## Data Preparation and Logic

### Excel (prototype stage)

Started in Excel (`Data for Updated Project.xlsx`) to shape the base dataset before scaling in SQL and Power BI.

- Combined core attributes (ID, tenure, income, premium status, repeat flag, etc.)
- Added calculated fields for satisfaction, engagement, and escalation risk
- Grouped customers into CLV tiers ($0‚Äì2k, $2k‚Äì5k, $5k‚Äì20k, $20k+)
- Created quick filters like premium member, repeat customer, and negative CLV

This file served as a prototype ‚Äî a quick way to clean data, test segmentation ideas, and validate logic before moving everything into SQL for automation.

### SQL (scaling the logic)

After validating the cleaned dataset in Excel, I rebuilt the logic in SQL to make it scalable and BI-ready.

**Key views:**
- `vw_core_profile` ‚Äì Customer attributes such as ID, registration date, tenure, demographics, income, and membership status  
- `vw_customer_value` ‚Äì Purchasing behavior including total purchases, average order value, lifetime value, CLV bucket, and return flags  
- `vw_customer_satisfaction` ‚Äì Experience metrics like average satisfaction score and escalation risk  
- `vw_engagement_for_bi` ‚Äì Consolidated, BI-ready view combining CLV, engagement, satisfaction, and risk indicators

**Highlights:**
- Implemented null handling and default values to prevent customer records from dropping out of analysis  
- Validated SQL outputs against the Excel prototype to confirm row counts and data consistency before loading into Power BI

### Power BI Data Model

With the SQL views finalized, the data was modeled in **Power BI** using a clear, scalable star schema designed for accuracy and easy maintenance.

**Model Overview**
- **Fact Tables:**  
  `F_public_customer_value`, `F_public_customer_engagement`, `F_public_customer_satisfaction`, `F_public_core_profile`  
- **Dimension Table:**  
  `DimCustomer` ‚Äî central customer key controlling all relationships and filters  
- **Measures Table:**  
  Dedicated layer for all DAX calculations to keep metrics standardized across reports  

**Core DAX Measures**
- Average Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)  
- Average Engagement Score  
- Average Satisfaction Score  
- % Repeat Customers  
- % Premium Members  
- Escalation Risk by CLV Tier and Engagement Level  

**Dashboard Pages**
1. **Customer Summary** ‚Äì high-level KPIs and engagement by satisfaction  
2. **Demographics & Retention** ‚Äì repeat rates, CLV distribution, and customer mix  
3. **Engagement & Escalation Risk** ‚Äì engagement vs. satisfaction, risk by CLV tier  
4. **Insights & Actions** ‚Äì key findings and strategic recommendations  

This Power BI model translates the Excel and SQL logic into an interactive, executive-level view of customer health and retention risk ‚Äî similar to what a CS Ops or CX team would use in Gainsight or Salesforce.

## Real World Role Alignment

This project reflects the kind of work done by:
- **Customer Success Operations (CS Ops) Analysts**
- **Customer Experience / Voice of Customer Analysts**
- **Business Analysts focused on Retention or Loyalty**
- **Support Operations Analysts** monitoring escalation and account health

**Skills demonstrated:**
- Data cleaning and segmentation in Excel  
- Translating manual logic into scalable SQL views  
- Power BI data modeling with DAX for real-time metrics  
- Turning operational data into actionable insights for customer retention  

This is the type of end-to-end workflow you‚Äôd discuss in an interview ‚Äî moving from raw data to a repeatable model that helps answer:  
> ‚ÄúWhich customers need attention first, and why?‚Äù

---
## Next Steps

The next iteration of this project will focus on making the model smarter and more automated.

- Add **trend tracking** to show how engagement and satisfaction change over time  
- Automate **data refresh** so Power BI always reflects the latest inputs  
- Introduce a **light churn-risk score** that blends satisfaction, engagement, escalation, and CLV  
- Tighten alignment between the **Excel prototype** and **SQL views** for better consistency  

**Vision:**  
Turn this into a lightweight **CS Ops workload routing tool** that answers a simple but powerful question:  
> ‚ÄúWhich customers need attention right now, and why?‚Äù

## Reflection

This project was about building something real ‚Äî not just another demo dashboard.  
I started with messy customer data, cleaned and organized it in Excel, moved the logic into SQL so it could scale, and finished with a Power BI dashboard that helps make sense of customer health and engagement.  

It pushed me to connect the technical work to actual business value ‚Äî figuring out what metrics matter, how to structure the data, and how to show it in a way that drives action.  

More than anything, it made me think like a CS Ops analyst: turning data into decisions, not just charts.
