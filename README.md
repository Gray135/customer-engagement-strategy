## üß≠ 1-Minute Summary
Built a full-cycle **Customer Success Operations (CS Ops)** model using **Excel, SQL, and Power BI** to simulate how teams track engagement, identify at-risk customers, and plan retention outreach.  
The dashboard combines CLV tiers, satisfaction scores, and escalation risk to show where attention is needed most ‚Äî like a simplified Gainsight or Salesforce CS view.  
This project highlights practical skills in **SQL view design, Power BI data modeling, DAX measures,** and turning CX data into business insights.

## Dashboard Preview

The dashboard connects Excel logic, SQL structuring, and Power BI visuals to simulate how a CS Ops or retention team might prioritize outreach.  
It highlights how CLV, engagement, satisfaction, and escalation risk interact across customer segments.

### Key Metrics

| **Metric** | **Value / Description** |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| Total Customers | 4,327 |
| Premium Members | ~19% of total base |
| Avg CLV | $592.85 |
| Avg Satisfaction Score | 6.63 / 10 |
| Repeat Customer Rate | 84% |
| Top Segment by Volume | $0‚Äì2k CLV (95.7% of all customers) |
| Avg Income Index | ~1.89 (skews mid-income, not luxury) |

> These metrics come from simulated customer data and are used to model retention strategy, not report on any real business.

---

#### 3. Engagement & Escalation Risk  
![Engagement and Risk](images/Engagement_and_Risk.png)  
Displays engagement and satisfaction by CLV bucket and channel (email, mobile, social).  
Visualizes escalation risk distribution across customer tiers.

---

#### 4. Key Insights & Next Steps  
![Insights and Actions](images/Insights_and_Actions.png)  
Summarizes key findings (e.g., 96% of base in low CLV) and connects engagement, satisfaction, and CLV to actionable next steps ‚Äî a concise, leadership-level view.

## Business Objective

Customer Success and Operations teams need to know:
- Who‚Äôs most at risk of churning?
- What‚Äôs driving engagement and satisfaction?
- Where should outreach and resources go first?

This project simulates that workflow using **Excel ‚Üí SQL ‚Üí Power BI**, mirroring how CS Ops teams use tools like Gainsight or Salesforce to manage account health and retention.

**Goal:**  
Create a full-cycle model that:
1. Flags at-risk customers  
2. Segments them by CLV, engagement, and satisfaction  
3. Recommends a data-driven ‚Äúnext best action‚Äù for retention and outreach  

The result is a BI-ready framework blending Excel business logic, scalable SQL views, and Power BI visuals ‚Äî the same kind of workflow used by CS Ops or VoC Analysts to prioritize high-impact accounts.

---

## Key Insights

| **Insight** | **What It Means** |
|--------------|------------------|
| 96% of customers fall in the low-CLV ($0‚Äì2k) range | The retention backbone ‚Äî focus here for scalable impact |
| High-CLV customers show lower engagement | Warning sign for targeted reactivation campaigns |
| Repeat rate (84%) | Indicates strong loyalty base to maintain and expand |
| Income Index (~1.9) | Spending skews mid-tier, not luxury ‚Äî outreach tone matters |
| Channel engagement varies | Different segments prefer email, mobile, or social ‚Äî personalize contact strategy |

These insights link directly to the dashboard visuals, showing how engagement, satisfaction, and CLV shape retention priorities.

## Data Source

All data is **simulated**, structured to reflect what a real CS Ops or CX Analytics team might manage.

- Customer demographics (gender, income, country, tenure)  
- Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and total order value  
- Engagement and satisfaction scores  
- Premium membership and repeat status  
- Escalation risk and support interaction history  
- Channel engagement (email, mobile, social)  

No real customer information is used ‚Äî this dataset is purely for demonstration and portfolio purposes.

## Data Preparation and Logic

### Excel (Prototype Stage)
Initial data cleaning and logic testing began in **Excel** (`Data for Updated Project.xlsx`).  
The goal was to validate segmentation and ensure fields aligned before scaling in SQL.

- Combined key fields (ID, tenure, income, premium, repeat flag, etc.)  
- Calculated satisfaction, engagement, and escalation risk  
- Grouped customers into CLV tiers ($0‚Äì2k, $2k‚Äì5k, $5k‚Äì20k, $20k+)  
- Added status flags for premium members, repeaters, and negative CLV  

This served as the proof-of-concept layer ‚Äî a fast way to confirm the segmentation logic worked before automating it.

### SQL (Scaling the Logic)
Rebuilt the Excel logic into **SQL views** to make the data scalable and BI-ready.

**Key Views**
- `vw_core_profile` ‚Äì Base attributes (ID, registration date, tenure, demographics, income, membership)  
- `vw_customer_value` ‚Äì Purchasing data (total purchases, avg order value, lifetime value, CLV bucket, returns)  
- `vw_customer_satisfaction` ‚Äì Experience data (average satisfaction score, escalation risk)  
- `vw_engagement_for_bi` ‚Äì Consolidated BI-ready view combining CLV, engagement, satisfaction, and risk  

**Highlights**
- Implemented null handling and default values to preserve record coverage  
- Validated SQL output against Excel prototype for consistency before loading to Power BI

## Power BI Data Model

With SQL logic finalized, the data was modeled in **Power BI** using a star schema for maintainability and clarity.

**Model Overview**
- **Fact Tables:** `F_public_customer_value`, `F_public_customer_engagement`, `F_public_customer_satisfaction`, `F_public_core_profile`  
- **Dimension Table:** `DimCustomer` (central relationship control via customer_id)  
- **Measures Table:** Centralized DAX calculations  

**Core DAX Measures**
- Average CLV  
- Average Engagement Score  
- Average Satisfaction Score  
- % Repeat Customers  
- % Premium Members  
- Escalation Risk by CLV Tier and Engagement  

The model powers four report pages:
1. Customer Summary  
2. Demographics & Retention  
3. Engagement & Escalation Risk  
4. Insights & Actions

## Real-World Role Alignment

This project mirrors work done by:
- Customer Success Operations Analysts  
- CX / Voice of Customer Analysts  
- Retention-focused Business Analysts  
- Support Operations Analysts  

**Skills Demonstrated**
- Data cleaning and segmentation (Excel)  
- SQL logic design and BI view creation  
- Power BI modeling and DAX  
- Translating metrics into retention strategy  

An interviewer could ask, ‚ÄúHow do you decide which customers to focus on first?‚Äù ‚Äî this project is your practical answer.

---

## Next Steps

Future improvements planned:
- Add **trend tracking** to visualize engagement over time  
- Automate **Power BI refresh** for live data connections  
- Add a **churn-risk score** combining satisfaction, engagement, escalation, and CLV  
- Improve consistency between the Excel prototype and SQL logic  

**Vision:**  
Evolve this into a lightweight **CS Ops workload routing tool** that answers:  
> ‚ÄúWhich customers need attention right now, and why?‚Äù

## Reflection

This project was built to simulate real-world retention analytics used in CS Ops.  
Starting with messy data, I cleaned and organized it in Excel, rebuilt it in SQL for scale, and visualized it in Power BI for decision-making.  

It reinforced three key skills:
- Building structured logic that scales from Excel ‚Üí SQL ‚Üí Power BI  
- Designing DAX measures that turn data into insight, not just charts  
- Thinking like a CS Ops analyst ‚Äî balancing data accuracy with business context
